    <h1>Environment and Reproduction</h1>
    <p>
        It is a beautiful season plant. It adapts to drought by reducing its leaf area and its deep lobes. Lowlands are preferred. It spreads in the steppes, and on the slopes with sandy soils or silt rich in nitrogen. It is propagated by seeds sown directly into the soil at the beginning of spring.

    <h1>Pastoral importance</h1>

        The grazing animals are well cared for, especially goats and sheep, with other grazing species. If they are aloes, they harm the young sheep, causing intestinal poisonings that may lead to the death of newborns.
