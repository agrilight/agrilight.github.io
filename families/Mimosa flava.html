    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>
        Members of this genus are among the few plants capable of rapid movement, The leaves of the Mimosa pudica close quickly when touched. Some mimosas raise their leaves in the day and lower them at night, and experiments done by Jean-Jacques d'Ortous de Mairan on mimosas in 1729 provided the first evidence of biological clocks.
