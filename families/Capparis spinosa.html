Light-loving, well-drained soil, tolerates low temperatures. Seeds are light-loving, as their germination rate is greater if they are exposed to light, that is, they are on the surface of the soil, which dries quickly and therefore their germination should be under abundant water conditions allow the seed to germinate and the seedling to grow and stability, and therefore this species grows in places with bountiful water resources. Capers are cultivated in some southern European countries.
