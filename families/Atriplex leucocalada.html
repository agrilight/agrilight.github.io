    <h1>Pastoral importance</h1>
    <p>
        After the white groats, the branches are one of the best pastoral plants in terms of nutritional value and ability to graze due to the abundance of its vegetative growth and containing a high amount of indigestible protein, as its percentage is equivalent to what is found in Hijazi clover. Throughout the year, whether it is bare or bass, it is a declining plant because of its weak resistance to overgrazing. It is characterized by a short growing season and ten months are limited to 4 months April - May - June, and it enters 4 semi-dormant phase after that.
